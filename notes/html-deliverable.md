# HTML Deliverable Notes

## Things I learned
- I struggled getting my table headers to render properly and discovered it was because each entry in the header should be tagged with `th` and not `td`
- An SVG icon can be included in HTML easily, and Google offers free icons, one of which I downloaded and used to signal that the link to my GitHub page would open a new tab
- The Live Server Extension is really helpful in seeing immediately the effect my changes make on the webpage
