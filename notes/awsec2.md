# AWS EC2

## Things I learned

- Starting up a server instance with AWS isn't that difficult
- Using an AMI allows you to use a server with settings and packages that are preconfigured
- Associating an elastic IP address with my instance allows my server to keep the same IP address even if it stops or if I have to upgrade to another tier
