# GitHub

## New Things I Learned
- I learned more about what [forks](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md#forks) are
    - You can essentially clone a repo and pull and merge updates as you continue working on the project
- I learned how to use **Markdown** <sub>I guess somewhat</sub>
- GitLens is a really cool VS Code extension

## Things That Were Review
- The importance of version control and the power of GitHub
- Some simple Git commands (status, add, commit, push, pull, etc.)

## Things I Want To Do
- **Commit to working every day or every other day on my startup project**
