# Job App

JobApp is a web app that helps users track information about their job applications. I originally developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and later converted it to React. The backend server is implemented with Node.js and Express.js to handle user registration/sign in and CRUD (creating, reading, updating, and deleting) jobs. I also implemented a 3rd party job search API courtesy of Jobicy that allows users to search for jobs using key words and add these jobs directly within JobApp. The app also uses a Websocket connection to allow users to share jobs with friends.

See a demo of the app back in its heyday when I was actually running it on an EC2 instance [here.](https://www.loom.com/share/5d4a6d27d29547b9ba69127d4e1d8a94?sid=906df101-aa9a-4353-99be-9270926d701d)
